Project Specification Feedback
==================

Commit graded: 

### The product backlog (9/10)

The product backlog is generally good. You have given detailed information about what task you are going to finish, but the tasks are still big. We expect you to break them into small subtasks and assign them explicit to every person. Two minor advice: 1) present the backlog using spreadsheet. It is easy to track and will help you follow to update of the requirements; 2) estimate the cost of each task. That will help you split the task equally, also track the total progress.

### Data models (9/10)

For now, your data model is simple and clear. If what I understand is correct, except the Player model, you will need an ephemeral role used to represent the states of Player in the Game. We expect you to provide more detailed mapping between your model and the wireframe you provide. For example, Player Records should also be presented as Model in the database if you want to show them in the website.

### Wireframes or mock-ups (10/10)

The wireframes are pretty clean and easy to understand in general. As we expected, the webapp includes a lot of interactions with the user, so probably in the actual design, a more detailed prototype should be made.
